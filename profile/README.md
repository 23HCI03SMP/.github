# Optimised Numerical Methods for the Computation of Particles in Fusion Hotspots and Particle Interactions in Magnetized Liner Inertial Fusion (MagLIF)

## Description

## Barnes Hut Simulation
In magnetized liner inertial fusion (MagLIF), a magnetic field is used to compress a plasma to achieve fusion. In this process, the plasma is subject to Coulomb explosion, where the ions in the plasma are rapidly accelerated away from each other due to their mutual repulsion. Understanding Coulomb explosion and particle interactions is crucial for optimizing the performance of MagLIF. The Barnes-Hut simulation is a widely used algorithm to efficiently compute long-range interactions in N-body systems, which has also been used to study the behavior of plasmas in MagLIF. 

Overall, the Barnes-Hut simulation has proven to be an efficient and accurate method for simulating the behavior of plasmas in MagLIF, particularly in the context of Coulomb explosion and particle interactions. It has been used in a number of studies to investigate the performance of MagLIF and to optimize its design.
