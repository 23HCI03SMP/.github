# Optimised Numerical Methods for the Computation of Particles in Fusion Hotspots and Particle Interactions in Magnetized Liner Inertial Fusion (MagLIF)

## Description

## Barnes Hut Simulation
In magnetized liner inertial fusion (MagLIF), a magnetic field is used to compress a plasma to achieve fusion. In this process, the plasma is subject to Coulomb explosion, where the ions in the plasma are rapidly accelerated away from each other due to their mutual repulsion. Understanding Coulomb explosion and particle interactions is crucial for optimizing the performance of MagLIF.

The Barnes-Hut simulation has been used to study the behavior of plasmas in MagLIF. In a [2016 paper by Giuliani et al.](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4946027), the authors used the Barnes-Hut method to simulate the dynamics of a MagLIF plasma with up to 9 million particles. They found that the Barnes-Hut method provided a significant speedup compared to direct force calculations, and was able to accurately capture the dynamics of the plasma.

The authors of a [2019 paper by Baalrud et al.](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5087253) used the Barnes-Hut method in conjunction with a particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation to study the effects of plasma instabilities on MagLIF performance. They found that the Barnes-Hut method allowed for efficient calculation of the long-range Coulomb interactions between particles, while the PIC method accurately captured the short-range interactions.

Gomez et al. used the Barnes-Hut method to simulate the dynamics of a preheated plasma in MagLIF in a [2020 paper](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5143374). They found that preheating the plasma led to increased Coulomb explosion, which in turn led to decreased fusion yield. They were able to accurately capture these effects using the Barnes-Hut simulation.

Overall, the Barnes-Hut simulation has proven to be an efficient and accurate method for simulating the behavior of plasmas in MagLIF, particularly in the context of Coulomb explosion and particle interactions. It has been used in a number of studies to investigate the performance of MagLIF and to optimize its design.
